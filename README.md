This code was developed for the thesis entitled: "A contribution to the dynamics of epilepsy: identification and control for seizure attenuation" and then published in the Journal of Neural Systems:

Brogin JAF, Faber J, Bueno DD. An Efficient Approach to Define the Input Stimuli to Suppress Epileptic Seizures Described by the Epileptor Model. Int J Neural Syst. 2020 Nov;30(11):2050062. doi: 10.1142/S0129065720500628. Epub 2020 Sep 16. PMID: 32938259.

Essentially, the code was developed on the Spyder platform and it consists two separate files: LMIs_Epileptor.py is an optimization routine for computing the gains of the fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno controller based on the concept of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs); Control_approach_Epileptor_RK4.py uses the computed gains in a closed-loop routine to suppress the seizures described by the Epileptor model using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm.
